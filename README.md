# NeuralNetwork-Training-Costs
Examining a Neural Network for Recognizing Digits
        The objective of this project is to strengthen the understanding of the math behind neural networks, specifically to calculate loss functions using the numpy library and understand the different uses of mean squared error, cross entropy and loglikelihood. 
        After the appropriate cost functions were coded, the model was trained and subsequent results printed and analyzed.
