NN578_network.py
==============
Modified from the NNDL book code "network.py" to be 
compatible with Python 3.
Also from "network2.py", the function ("load(filename)") is
added to this file, renamed as "load_network(filename)".
This function loads a saved network encoded in a json file.

network.py
~~~~~~~~~~
A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
algorithm for a feedforward neural network.  Gradients are calculated
using backpropagation.  Note that I have focused on making the code
simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized,
and omits many desirable features.
